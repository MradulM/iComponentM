  s.description      = 'In this post Iâ€™m going to show you how to develop and distribute in-house private code libraries using Cocoapods. Cocoapods by the way is an excellent tool for managing third party dependencies in a project. It not only provides a way for easily integrating those dependencies but also allows you create your own dependencies and manage them as well. And best of all, you can it to simplify code sharing inside your organization. This is known as a private pod and is described in great detail on the cocoapods site.'
